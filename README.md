# Convergence prediction for the coordination of astrobot swarms (constrained version)
In this version, the parity of astrobots [1] are all fixed and identicial. [Parity is the direction of the rotation associated with the second arm of an astrobot.] The predictor is an augmented version of $k$-NN algorithm to classify the convergence result of each astrobot which can be either `successful` or `unsuccessful` [2].
